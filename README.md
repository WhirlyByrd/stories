### Debuggin Through Trial and Error

Testing and debugging code is something that all developers must do for any project. I like to test regularly throughout the coding process. I test each function after it is written and sometimes I will check individual pieces within the function itself to make sure it is doing what I want. Using a simple console.log() will give me a good idea on what data is being returned or not.

When there is an error, I find that the first thing that should be checked is the console either inside VSCode or Chrome’s Dev Tools. The consoled error usually can identify where exactly the code failed to run. In my experience it is usually a simple typo or syntax error. Sometimes, though, I will scour my code and still not find the error. Paired programming helps to resolve this issue.

A second pair of eyes will more easily see what I cannot. I first learned this as a graphic designer. It is common practice to have other designers critique your project because they can either see mistakes faster or they can come up with very useful suggestions. Our brains tend to see what we think “should” be there and so we become somewhat blind to some of the most obvious mistakes. This is why I enjoy paired programming so much. We can help each other develop cleaner, less error prone code from the beginning. It makes a project run smoother and more efficiently in the long run. 

When in doubt, google is a developer’s best friend. Odds are that a developer has had the same problem before and has asked for help in a forum such as stackoverflow. There are many more useful resources like geeksforgeeks, w3schools, freecodecamp, and of course, Youtube. 

The bug may be simple and quick to resolve. It could be more complex than anticipated. Each time a bug is encountered is it an opportunity to learn something new. When I do resolve it, I come out with more experience. If or when the error occurs again, I should be able to resolve it faster.
